Loan_Calculator_with_text_format.rb prompts the user for name, currency, loan value, interest rate and payment duration. 

Each of these inputs (with the exception of name) are validated and only accepted if within they are within the specfied critia. 
The inputs are passed into methods; that will format text, numbers and calculate. The output are displayed and the program is 
looped until the user decides to finish.

The Loan_Calculator_with_text_format.rb uses an external reference text_format.rb to format it's prompts and outputs 
using ascii code.
